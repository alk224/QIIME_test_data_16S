## Settings descriptions:

## QIIME SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	Reference	(database reference fasta -- eg greengenes)
##	Taxonomy	(database taxonomy file -- eg greengenes)
##	Tree	(database tree file -- eg greengenes)
##	Chimeras	(fasta for filtering against -- eg gold.fa)
##	Alignment_template	(template file -- eg core_set_aligned.fasta.imputed)
##	Alignment_lanemask	(lanemask file -- eg lanemask_in_1s_and_0s)
##	Split_libraries_qvalue	(Minimum quality for split libraries.  A value of 19 returns q20 or better data.)
##	Split_libraries_minpercent	(Minimum percent of high quality base calls per read.  Recommend 0.95.)
##	Split_libraries_maxbad	(Max bad base calls before truncating a read.  Recommend no higher than 1.)
##	Threads_chimera_filter	(Subsearches to use during chimera filtering -- increase for large data sets.)
##	Threads_pick_otus	(Threads to use during OTU picking -- limit to # available processors.)
##	Threads_assign_taxonomy	(Threads to use during tax assignment -- Will use no more than 12 threads for RDP method.)
##	Threads_align_seqs	(Threads to use during sequence alignment -- limit to # available processors.)
##	RDP_confidence	(Confidence bootstrap value required to make an assignment.  0.5-0.6 seems to work well.)
##	RDP_max_memory	(Will need a minimum of 6000.  Value is in MB.  Larger datasets or reference databases will require this value to be increased.  Decrease your thread count for tax assignment so you don't run out of RAM.)
##	RC_seqs	(True or False.  If your raw data is in opposite orientation from database, set to true to reverse complement after demultiplexing.)
##	Prefix_length	(Length of prefix to collapse on in bp)
##	Suffix_length	(Length of suffix to collapse on in bp)
##	OTU_picker	(blast, cdhit, swarm, openref, custom_openref, ALL -- cap sensitive)
##	Tax_assigner	(rdp, uclust, blast, ALL -- cap sensitive)
##	CPU_cores	(Number of cores to use during parallel processing steps.)

## FASTQ-JOIN SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	Min_overlap	(Minimum overlap required during read joining steps.)
##	Max_mismatch	(Maximum mismatch allowed during read joining steps.)

## FASTQ-MCF SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	Threads_mcf	(Threads to use while filtering primer sequences from raw fastq data.)

## FASTQ_MULTX SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	Multx_errors	(Maximum indexing mismatches allowed during initial demultiplexing step.)

## SMALT SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	PhiX_index	(ABSOLUTE path to your PhiX index generated with smalt.  Do NOT include file extensions.)
##	Threads_smalt	(Threads to use while filtering PhiX from raw fastq data.)

## ITSx SETTINGS BELOW HERE
## 	Threads_ITSx	(Threads to use during ITSx filtering -- limit to # available processors)
## 	ITSx_options	(Options to use for ITSx -- see ITSx manual for details)

## Settings in use for eqw.sh script below (without leading "#" characters).  Order is unimportant.
